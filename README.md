# Cassky Website

A small personal site created as a surprise.

## Run locally
1. Open `index.html` in a browser. For full local testing, serve with a simple static server (recommended):

```bash
# Python 3 (from project root)
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new repository on GitHub and push the project.
2. In repository Settings > Pages, set source to `main` (or `gh-pages`) branch and root folder `/`.
3. Wait a few minutes and your site will be live.

## Notes
- Replace `your_best_photo.jpg` with a real photo in the project root.
- If you want the secret page to open after unlocking (instead of revealing inline), that's possible — I can wire it up.
