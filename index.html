    <h3>Life and Chess</h3>
    <p class="essay">Chess is more than a game — it's a practice in attention, choice, and consequence. At a glance, the chessboard is a grid of black and white squares; in life we read the alternating patterns of risk and opportunity. Each move on the board mirrors a decision we make, and like life, chess invites both planning and improvisation.</p>

    <p class="essay">Good chess players think in layers: immediate tactics, medium-term plans, and a long-term strategy. So do we. We balance small, tactical responses to daily problems with larger plans for relationships, study, or career. The best outcomes come from aligning short moves with a meaningful unfolding plan.</p>

    <p class="essay">Chess trains you to anticipate — to imagine possible replies and prepare for them. In life that translates to empathy and foresight: anticipating how others may react, and choosing actions that leave room for growth rather than creating avoidable conflict.</p>

    <p class="essay">Both chess and life teach the value of patience and learning from mistakes. A blunder on the board is an opportunity to study, to understand why a choice went wrong and how to avoid it next time. In life, mistakes shape character when we reflect and adapt.</p>

    <p class="essay">Finally, chess reminds us of limits: not every game ends in victory, and sometimes a draw or a graceful resignation is the wisest outcome. Likewise, accepting limits in life — and playing the long game with curiosity and kindness — often leads to the richest experiences.</p>

    <p class="essay">In short, chess is a compact, beautiful model of decision-making: plan, test, adapt, and be kind to yourself in the process. The lessons carry off the board and into the moments that shape a life.</p>

            <p>Hey Cassky 
                Wanted to do something extra so I chose to also write you a letter even though they may be a bit outdated today.
                Just consider it a way for me to practice my writing skills whie also conveying a message to my special somebody.
                You would be jealous if you ever met her because she is the kindest, most loving, caring and wholesome person you will ever meet.
                I only wish I could say this things to you irl but I gotta do what I can, right.
                Who would have guessed that we would be able to make it to almost a year despite being 100's if not 1000's of kilometers apart. 
                There may have been some ups(we barely have things we disagree on or even argue about.) and downs(The blocking) but I am glad that we made it through all that.
                I have said it before and I will say it again, I am so proud of you for everything you have achieved so far and I know you will achieve even more in the future.
                </p>
